# Identifying-top-FIFA-influencers-on-Twitter

Our objective in this project was to identify the top influencers talking about FIFA on Twitter. This was done in two parts. 

In Part I, we used the training data on social influence to build a model predicting influencers, to find out the important predictors of influence, and to quantify the financial value of influence. 

In the second part, we collected tweets, and used the predictors from Part I to identify 20 top influencers in the world of FIFA.
